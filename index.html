                <p class="text-muted text-left">Quaint little restaurant tucked inside a by-lane of Juhu. Blink and you will miss the entrance to the cafe. So be alert enough to spot the black signboard that says "Prithvi cafe" while you are on the main road. The restaurant has a reasonably good menu at reasonable prices. The food is delicious, the servings are quite large and some dishes can be shared by 2 people. Attracts quite a trendy crowd of aspiring celebrities on show days. Be sure to book in advance to avoid disappointments. On other days, the crowd there is pretty hep & happening. Hosts the famous "Prithvi theater fest", which you must attend if possible. </p>

                <p class="text-muted text-left">It's a wonderful place. Must visit this place. Must haired tour guide so it will be batter to under stand all the things. It is a beautifully maintained small complex with yellow painted walls. It's a historical site famous among tourists. It contains a number of different devices that were used to measure time in different eras in the Indian history. It has a nominal ticket price of ₹15 for Indians but about ₹225-250 for foreigners. Nice place to visit. We had an incredible experience visiting this observatory and seeing the accuracy of the astronomical instruments built around 300 years ago</p>

We can see religious God and Goddess paintings believed by Buddhism inside which can give spiritual power to one who prays there with clean heart. From the compound of Monastery on a clear day one can have a scenery of hills all around which is great for nature lovers.</p>

Yet you will enjoy it a lot.There is at the beginning of the movie a (spoiler alert) head dismemberment that is quite impressive.

                                    Experts agree the three biggest achievements of Biden’s first 100 days have been the COVID-19 vaccination distribution, passage of his $1.9 trillion economic relief bill, and the rejoining of the Paris Climate Accord.In a New York Times analysis the Trump administration: “dismantled major climate policies and rolled back many more EPA rules governing clean air, water, wildlife and toxic chemicals. At the same time, the DOI worked to open up more land for oil and gas leasing by limiting wildlife protections and weakening environmental requirements for projects.”After cleaning house, Biden appointed leaders at the EPA and DOI dedicated to rescuing and preserving our precious environment, Michael S. Regan at EPA and Deb Haaland (the first native American cabinet member secretary) at DOI. Their very early accomplishments have been very impressive.</p>

Attacks on water infrastructure cut off thousands of people from access to safe drinking water, exacerbating a cholera outbreak that has caused an estimated 4,000 deaths since April 2017. Fighting also damaged Yemen’s agricultural infrastructure, contributing to the food insecurity of an estimated 16.2 million people.

                                    The environmental impacts of the conflict in Yemen could worsen. The oil tanker Safer has been left moored off an oil terminal in the Red Sea for over five years, holding over one million barrels of crude oil. The UN has warned that the Safer tanker is at risk of leaking, exploding, or catching fire due to the lack of maintenance, although the Huthi armed group (which controls the area) has repeatedly delayed access to a UN technical assessment team.
